# Object Oriented Software Development - SWEN20003
This repo contains codes that were written for each assigment. This is also the first time I was exposed with Github and understanding its basic commands.

# Project Overview
## Project 1
The first project was to recreate the famous, classic game - Pacman. In this project, I was tasked with create the game environment, positioning of the ghosts, wall colision, and Pacman's movement. This project enhance understanding of rendering as well as helped me improved my coding skills in Java. It also gave me a good experience on how game logic are being checked within the game and enhanced my understanding regarding the "hitbox" concept.

## Project 2
The second project required a more advance version of the first one. Previously, the ghosts are all static and they do not chase Pacman, ultimately allowing the player to freely roam around the environment without fear of being chased by the ghosts. However, this version required me to automate each ghosts' movement and they all have different type of movesets.
